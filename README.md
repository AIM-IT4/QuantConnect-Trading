QuantConnect Trading Strategy
This repository contains a simple trading strategy implemented using QuantConnect. The strategy is based on [insert your strategy's objective/idea here].

Getting Started
To use this strategy, you'll need to sign up for a QuantConnect account and create a new project. Then, clone this repository and copy the contents of the main.py file into your new project.

You may also need to modify the code to suit your needs, such as adjusting the algorithm parameters, modifying the security universe, or changing the trading rules.

Usage
Once you have the code in your project, you can backtest the strategy using the QuantConnect backtesting engine. You can also deploy the strategy to live trading using the QuantConnect brokerage integration.

Be sure to carefully test your strategy and monitor its performance before committing real funds to live trading.

Resources
If you're new to QuantConnect, check out the QuantConnect documentation, which provides detailed information on how to use the platform and implement trading strategies.

If you have any questions or issues with this strategy, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
